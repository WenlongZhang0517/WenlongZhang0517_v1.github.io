I am Wenlong Zhang and I currently work as a research intern in Multimedia Laboratory at SIAT-CAS & CUHK. My research interests lie primarily in computer vision and machine learning. My current work involves GAN-based super resolution and face blind super resolution, etc. I am also interested in the application of learning to rank in computer vision. Before that, I have experience working in image restoration on remote sening data. I am trying to solve the problem in real-world and further find the course of nature behind the problem.
