Wenlong is a Ph.D. student in Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof. [Xiao-Ming Wu](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/). He also works closely with Prof. [Chao Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=OSDCB0UAAAAJ) and [Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/team). Previously, He was research assistant in [X-Pixel Group](http://xpixel.group/index) in Multimedia Laboratory at SIAT-CAS. He received the MSc degree from Beijing Institute of Technology University in 2018.

His research interests include GAN and meta-learning (few-shot/metric learning), particularly focusing on image/video restoration tasks, such as super-resolution.
