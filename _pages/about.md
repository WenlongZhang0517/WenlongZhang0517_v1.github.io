I am Wenlong Zhang and I currently work as a research intern at X-Pixel Group[http://xpixel.group/index] in Multimedia Laboratory at SIAT-CAS & CUHK. My research interests lie primarily in computer vision and machine learning. My current work involves GAN-based super resolution and generative model, etc. Before that, I have experience working about image restoration on remote sening data. I am trying to solve the problem in real-world and further explore the law of nature behind the problem.
